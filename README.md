Just a super-simple example for a guy I'm trying to help with fetching some data from react app that needs CORS setup on the server side

FILES:
------
- react-app : default react app generated with creat-react-app tool, with your Post component added. To use from within this folder run first: npm install, and then npm start
- server: contains your json data and a basic php script just setting the minimal required headers and returning the json. Copy these 2 files into your localhost's webserver root
